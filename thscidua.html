      <h3>Scientific Dualism</h3>
      <p id="a690"><a class="anchor" href="#a690"></a>
        The (potential) confirmation of the reincarnation and
        the idealistic interpretation of the quantum uncertainty
        could form the basis for a new, scientifically provable dualistic world view.
        This would accept (and even justify) the presence of mental
        principles behind the physical domain,
        and would look at the humans as primarily spiritual beings
        attached to a physical body during the diurnal periods of their
        earthly lives.
        It would recognize the sense of the individual human existence in
        the continuous development from the level of the animals
        to that of the gods during series of worldly lives,
        (mainly) with the help of the contemplation and intellectual reflection over the
        experiences and impressions collected in the successive incarnations.
        The purpose of the civilization and the society would (almost
        exclusively) be the support of these individual development processes,
        firstly by ensuring sufficiently rich life contents
        (e.g. through enabling a dilettantish and amateurish life and work style),
        and secondly by providing the opportunities and capabilities needed to
        analyze these experiences mentally in a fruitful manner,
        and to transform them successfully into personal and perpetual wisdom.
      </p>
      <p id="a06e"><a class="anchor" href="#a06e"></a>
        A significant advantage of a scientifically provable and
        continuously improvable dualistic world view would be the possibility
        to eliminate finally the various religions from the human civilization,
        and to invalidate any further efforts for reviving and restoring them.
        The great and most important questions of the mankind
        would eventually be answered by the science, with scientific methods and
        accuracy, and there will be no need (and chance) to search for the explanations
        anywhere else, than in the sphere of the intelligence and reason.
        Such success of the science could decrease considerably in a short time
        the hatred and intolerance in the world, for several reasons:
        1. the religions and their (not really tolerant) teachings
        would lose their relevance almost immediately;
        2. we would have a scientific method to answer the essential questions,
        which could be accepted by anyone in the world (with at least a
        minimum amount of common sense);
        3. we would understand more completely and deeply the nature
        of the intolerance and ignorance;
        4. through the (presumable) immense development of the psychology we would
        possess much more sophisticated methods to manage these personal mental
        deficiencies, and to guide these (as yet) ignorant persons to a higher level
        of understanding and intelligence.
      </p>
      <p id="aa2c"><a class="anchor" href="#aa2c"></a>
        Nationalism and other types of chauvinism could also be invalidated
        with the help of the scientific dualism, since it would be clear
        that the groups we are born into (nation, language, color, (sub)culture, etc.)
        play only an ephemeral part in our existence,
        and they can be changed or switched even from life to life
        (with the exception of the gender, which is most certainly constant through the various incarnations).
        Additionally, the large problems ahead of the mankind could also
        be handled more efficiently using the (potential) discoveries of
        the scientific dualism: e.g., the present generations could not
        hope to escape the consequences of the global warming anymore (since in their
        next lives they will have to face the aftermath);
        or the vanishing of the fear from the death
        (and of the irrational joy over the birth of children)
        could aid to manage the problem of the overpopulation;
        or the refocusing of our attentions and life aims from the earthly matters
        to the intellectual and spiritual dimensions
        could immensely help reduce the inequality in the world
        and diminish the disadvantageous effects of an excessive economical production.
      </p>
      <p id="a6cc"><a class="anchor" href="#a6cc"></a>
        The findings of the scientific dualism could also have a positive impact
        on the relations of the children and the adults, since it would become
        clear that being a child is only a temporary stage between two adult existences,
        and that a newborn has already his/her own personality formed by the previous
        incarnations. This discovery could significantly temper the (not really reasonable) admiration
        for the children observable in the Western societies today (presumably originating
        in a Jewish-Protestant materialism and infantilism), and could help revive
        the much healthier child-adult relationship of the traditional cultures,
        where the juveniles are also treated as (smaller sized) grownups.
        The parents' affection for "their own" children would reveal itself
        as a not justifiable irrationality, since it would be shown evidently by the science,
        that only the physique and the genomes of the infants are derived from that of the parents
        (while their spirits are completely independent and autonomous),
        and barely the constraints of the natural biological reproduction
        necessitate for the creation of a new body the usage of two existing ones.
        Consequently, the children could get back the opportunity from the society
        to live and spend their times together with all the adults (not only with "their" parents)
        all day long (not only in the evenings),
        and to learn their professions and acquire their knowledge through the
        medium of playing and imitating (as it is the case in the traditional
        cultures), instead of suffering for decades from the unscientific
        and inhuman "teaching" methods of the organized school system,
        which treats the children as if they had no own personality,
        and their soul were tabula rasa and completely formable by authoritarian and
        tyrannical means.
      </p>
      <p id="a7ba"><a class="anchor" href="#a7ba"></a>
        The discoveries of the scientific dualism could also affect considerably
        the woman-man relationship and the way we think about the gender and its
        role in the society. It could turn out that everybody has an own mate
        (of the opposite sex) with an exactly reversed basic personality structure,
        and that these two halves match each other perfectly by making the pair
        a complete whole (in a psychological and not (necessarily) a romantic sense).
        It could also become clear that the innerly followed gender roles are
        (similarly to the other types of inclinations) predominantly
        the reminiscences and resurrections of the earlier lives'
        (meanwhile internalized) habits and customs,
        and that there are much larger differences among the individual behaviors and
        characteristics within one sex than between the averages of the two sexes.
        As the only relevant difference between the females and males with an inherent
        nature (i.e. not resulting from cultural and social origin) would (most likely)
        be recognized the distinctive, much closer position of the males to the spiritual beings (or gods)
        behind the physical world, which makes them significantly more (or rather exclusively)
        capable of receiving and earning divine inspirations,
        while keeping the women completely out of this supernatural circle,
        but giving them the opportunity to partake in the divine influences
        through the company and medium of the men (the gods care for the men,
        and the men (should) care for the women).
        It could also be proven by the scientific dualism
        (with high probability) that the separation into female and male gender
        is in reality only a constraint dictated by the requirements of the
        biological reproduction mechanism, and that as the humanity develops
        and becomes qualified to build new organisms in artificial ways,
        this constraint could be invalidated, and the initial whole personality
        temporarily cut into two (not equal) halves would be united and merged again (and now forever).
      </p>
      <p id="ad98"><a class="anchor" href="#ad98"></a>
        Of course, the scientific dualism would also modify immensely the view we have
        on the individual personality and its source today. It could be proven that a personality
        is (almost) exclusively determined by social and other external factors,
        and those inborn characteristics and features, which presently we tend
        to see as manifestations of an unchangeable inner nature, would
        turn out to be the (internalized) habits of the earlier lives
        (and thus also social and cultural products).
        Only the most inner temperaments and forces of a person would count
        as part of his/her inherent character, but actually also these would
        be determined externally, since they would be the result of the
        genders' bisection (see above), and the other half of the separation would
        have the exact opposite personality structure with the complementary
        forces and temperaments.
        It would also be proven that, concerning the personal development, the hedonistic
        life style could be the most appropriate strategy, as long as it would be paired
        with sufficient amount of egoism and an almost rigorous reflectional and analytical attitude,
        since this method could ensure the fastest way to reach the level of the
        gods by trying out every other sources of the enjoyment, and ruling
        them out consecutively after getting disenchanted by them.
        (Obviously, this method would be much closer to the antique way of thinking
        (see e.g. the teaching of Diotima in
        <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato's_Symposium#Socrates">Plato's Symposium</a>),
        than to the Jewish-Protestant world view, which latter tries
        (and miserably fails) to reach the state of salvation
        by fulfilling scrupulously and punctiliously any obligations imposed by
        the religious, ethical and judicial rules and laws.)
