      <h3>Direct Democracy</h3>
      <p>
        In this section we try to inspect briefly,
        how would the discoveries of the <a href="thscidua.html" title="Scientific Dualism | Other Theories">scientific dualism</a>
        affect the political aspects of a rationally <a href="thsocorg.html" title="Society Organization | Other Theories">(re)constructed society</a>.
        First, the (potential) confirmation of the <a href="threinca.html" title="Reincarnation | Other Theories">reincarnation</a>
        would of course have an immense impact on the way, how we think about
        the equality of the humans, because it would become clear that
        this equality is actually only existent at the very first and at the very last
        stage of the individual development processes.
        We all started our development procedure at the levels of the animals,
        and we all will evolve into gods at the end of this process;
        but in the meantime there are enormous divergences observable
        between the various individuals, since almost infinite numbers of
        possible development paths can be constructed and followed,
        and each person has its own personal route (determined mainly
        by the circumstances and experiences of its incarnations),
        and even in relation to its own route is each individual differently located
        at a certain time.
        To illustrate this situation, let's suppose, that we have a group of
        travelers, who all start their journeys from the same point,
        and who all will end it at the very same finishing place, but
        who take different paths with varied speeds to reach this destination:
        a small group advances quickly in the most direct way,
        others are slower and wander hither and thither,
        and there are also those, who even do not really want to begin the journey
        and sit down already at the starting place.
        Can we say that these travelers are at the same level, that
        they are equal concerning there positions in relation to the final destination?
        Obviously not; they are equal in the meaning, that they
        all start from the same origin and will reach the
        very same goal, but they have different paces and follow different routes,
        which makes their progress almost individually distinct and
        their current phase at a certain time nearly completely unequal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our everyday experiences show clearly, that there are persons with definitely more and
        others with less developed capabilities, that some of them are closer
        to the level of the gods (or to that of the animals), than the others,
        that there are superior and inferior life styles and behaviors.
        Unfortunately, the liberal way of thinking that became dominant
        after the World War II, has almost completely forbidden
        (not very liberally) to phrase and to express this common perception,
        as it sees some kind of fascism in categorizing different
        individuals and their various ways of lives as having a higher
        or lower level of perfection.
        Of course, classifying people by their family names or physical
        origins into superior and inferior groups, and then eliminating
        the (supposed) substandard persons in concentration camps
        is not exactly an intelligent translation of the initial concept
        (although from the aspect of the reincarnation much less
        tragical, than the materialistic liberals tend (almost hysterically) to assert,
        because these individuals (most probably) have already been reborn since then,
        moreover possibly as citizens of Western Europe, Israel or the USA, and hence they potentially live much
        better lives now, than they would have had in the Eastern Europe of the post-WW2 era
        (not to mention, that being dead, i.e. existing entirely spiritually,
        could be even better for a person than living in the Western world));
        but this was only a fatal misinterpretation of the original idea
        (by the way mainly induced by the Jewish-Protestant materialism and the Anglo-Saxon
        <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism">social Darwinism</a>),
        and a dualistic interpretation of this concept
        (where the individuals are categorized by their earlier
        existences and experiences, and the inferior persons receive
        from the society extra amount of care and protection together with personalized development
        plans to make them able to compensate quickly for their shortcomings
        (originating in the imperfect structure and operation of the societies
        of their earlier lives))
        is much more humanistic and philanthropical, than any "liberal"
        system with its centrally dictated artifical egalitarianism
        (doing much more harm than good) could ever be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, this perception of the classification and the continuous development of the various persons is so normal and common,
        that we all (even the liberals) follow it instinctively in our everyday lives
        (e.g. when we start in a company as a novice and then we reach
        higher and higher levels during the years, or when we begin a hobby
        and ask repeatedly for the advice of the more experienced colleagues,
        trying to acquire their knowledge and to become a similarly trained
        professional),
        and the politics seems to be the only realm of the modern Western societies,
        where we do force the (almost completely misunderstood) conception of the
        equalitarianism, and (being literally frightened of any discrimination)
        attempt to exclude any type of differences
        by compelling general categories (or rather one single category)
        on the diversity and variegation of the entire society.
        Instead, the exact opposite strategy would be desirable:
        each person should represent a distinct category on its own
        with its individual experiences and personality structure,
        and the discrimination in the society should rather be increased
        to the extent, where everybody is favored by the community and can enjoy
        an individual treatment, which takes completely into account this person's
        current capabilities and shortcomings.
        For this purpose, a direct democratic system, based on the Internet
        and the modern telecommunication technologies, and operated with the help of
        sophisticated psychological and sociological algorithms,
        could be the most favorable solution, providing the community
        with the possibility to document its members' life thoroughly,
        and to follow and supervise mutually the individual and social activities
        horizontally (instead of the present bureaucratic
        vertical control), very similar in its operation to the social
        techniques and mechanisms of the traditional communities,
        only on a much higher communicational
        (and consequently also psychosociological) level.
        As a matter of fact, with the advent of the Internet, the
        societies now get back the opportunity to
        reinstall (in an improved manner) those traditional, natural and horizontal
        community regulation and normalization mechanisms,
        which were nearly entirely discarded at the beginning of the industrialization
        in the 18th and 19th century (when the masses moved into the towns and
        the rural and traditional communities dissolved), and which
        had to be in the past 200-300 years temporarily substituted by the unnatural
        vertical state institutions and bureaucratic regulatory techniques
        (laws, courts, statically hierarchical organizations, etc.) on the one side,
        and by the (likewise unnaturally) disorganized and
        emotionally overloaded families on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common misconception about the direct democracy seems to be,
        that it would mean the end of the individuality by forcing
        each person to accept a community decision suggested by
        some demagogue on a tumultuous popular assembly, and made
        by the public anonymously through a general cry.
        On the contrary, this way of governing is much more characteristic
        for the mass democracies of today, which are only working (at least
        to some extent) because of the existence of the international law,
        the journalism and the academic world;
        while in an (Internet-based) direct democracy exactly the individuals would
        be favored against the masses, and the persons would have to take
        individual responsibilities, for several reasons:
        1. there would be no mass events, everybody would make his/her
        own decision in a quiet room, physically separated from others;
        2. each decision could be traced back to its originator and to its
        supporters, even decades after the actual decision;
        3. before each decision, the professional level of any potential
        supporter could be determined by surveys and tests, and then his/her vote
        weighted with the result;
        4. the algorithms would follow the voting behavior and the feedbacks of the persons,
        and balance out their influences against each other;
        5. and, most importantly, in a direct democracy not general
        rules and laws would be made, but concrete decisions for concrete
        problems, and each case would be handled individually.
        E.g., in a direct democracy, there would be no general law
        about the taxation level, but instead, when the community
        needs money for a particular project,
        collections would be started, and the amounts of the
        taxation (or aid) would be determined individually (for natural
        and legal persons) in a multi-phased iteration process,
        where each person would offer a quantity and the community
        would accept it or change it, until a final compromise is reached.
        Similarly, there would be no centrally defined family allowance,
        but each family should indicate its requirement for an amount and its purpose
        (or directly for the object needed) one by one
        through the Internet-based system, and the community could decide,
        whether it would accept this demand and approve its satisfaction.
        There would be no (or only minimal) general laws and rules needed,
        as each personal request would be handled on its own, very similarly
        to the regulation mechanisms in the traditional societies and in the
        families. The whole society would be at the same time legislature, executive and
        judiciary in its entirety, where every day millions and billions
        of small decisions are made in concrete situations, managing
        actual problems and difficulties, without the necessity to define
        general rules and then to apply them at any cost and
        by subsuming the various actual cases forcefully under these
        primitive and tyrannical laws in a procrustean manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another misunderstanding about the (direct) democracy seems to be the tendency
        among their (self-proclaimed) advocates to avoid hierarchical
        organizations in any case, and to make the public, the community responsible
        for each decision in its whole.
        Instead, in a real direct democracy, the hierarchical project organization
        should be the most common one, as it assures the most effective
        way of working without the need of endless negotiations,
        and it provides the possibility of defining individual responsibilities
        and accountabilities.
        However, these hierarchical organizations should be dynamically constructed,
        mostly for only a single project, and even within this time the roles
        can (and should) be re-sorted and rearranged continuously (even daily,
        e.g. according to the current dispositions and energy levels),
        and the satisfaction of each member in the hierarchy with its role
        and with the present leaders of the project should be constantly
        monitored, and based on these feedbacks new arrangements suggested.
        The system should be capable of following any organizational changes
        immediately, and reflect them in the way, how it manages the communication
        between the members, and how it allocates the various tasks and jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To illustrate the problem concerning the different interpretations of a decision's democratic quality,
        let's suppose, that there is a demand to paint a room in a
        building and the color of it should be determined in a democratic way.
        Many people seem to think that the most democratic procedure
        would be to hold a public vote about this, and then the minority
        should accept the decision of the majority. Of course, we can
        call this procedure a democratic (or even the most democratic) one (as
        this interpretation has a long (particularly negative) tradition
        in the political philosophy), and there is no real sense of arguing
        over words; but it seems certain that the main cause of not
        having even today, with the Internet and the modern communicational
        technologies in our hands, a truly democratic society, is exactly
        this interpretation, which renders every single "democratic" decision
        a nightmare as well technically as psychologically (just see as a recent example for this
        the rise and fall of the
        <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_Germany">German Pirate Party</a>).
        Instead, in a rationally democratic system,
        each decision should be made (as quickly as possible) by one certain member of the community,
        and (s)he personally must take the full responsibility for that, even years or decades
        after the actual decision. Of course, if (s)he feels that (s)he needs a vote or survey
        about the public opinion to have an orientation for his/her decision,
        or to justify it later, then (s)he can hold this vote (through
        the Internet-based system), but the responsibility is inevitably his/her
        personally.
        E.g., in the example above, one single individual (designated by the algorithms of the system)
        should decide, which color will have the room, and a public vote could only play the role to
        support this person in its decision, while personally (s)he will be
        responsible for the choice (registered and documented by the managing system),
        and can be called to account for it even years later.
        In this solution not the endless referenda and public votes,
        but the high number of the necessary decisions, the advanced feedback
        opportunities and the continuous rotation in the hierarchical organizations
        would assure that everybody can assert his/her own rights and benefits
        (very similarly to the operation of the traditional societies and the families).
      </p>
      <p>
        An important question concerning the direct democracy is about the
        possibility and the actual way of its inauguration.
        Of course, it cannot and also should not be installed from one day
        to another, and also it would be the improper order to destruct
        the current, vertical state institutions at first, and then to
        start mulling over the idea of a new, Internet-based society (as e.g.
        many young people during the
        <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">Arab Spring</a>
        seemed to think).
        Instead, first the institutions and the solutions
        of the direct democracy should be created and installed,
        and then the two organizations (the bureaucratic and the civil one)
        would live and operate side by side for a longer time (for decades or even for centuries),
        mutually changing and fructifying each other, until the differences
        between the two completely vanish, and the bureaucratic organization
        becomes dynamical, direct and Internet-based,
        while the civil society evolves into a professional and serious community managing system.
        E.g., regarding the judiciary functions in the society,
        a parallel (Internet-based) system could be established,
        which would be used by the community to follow the various
        cases, to review the court decisions and to produce own resolutions
        as well; at some point (when the civil system is already sufficiently
        sophisticated for this), the persons could obtain the right to
        choose between the "official" court and the community decisions
        in certain types of cases, and then the number of these
        case types could continuously increase, until all (or the most) disputes can be resolved
        by the civil society, and only a minimal bureaucratic judiciary
        system would be needed.
        Or, concerning the taxation rules, a parallel civil monitoring
        system should be installed and operated, which would provide
        the community members with the opportunity to follow the various
        taxes imposed by the state on a personal basis, and to determine
        individually the taxation levels, which they would see as fair ones;
        after some time, the government would most probably be compelled to integrate these
        informations into the official taxation solution, and eventually the
        two systems would be completely amalgamated.
        Or, to give a final example, regarding the legislative functions
        each law (or even each separate paragraph of it) should become
        evaluable by the community, and on the other side the civil society should work
        out own parallel systems to regulate community processes (e.g.
        with the help of psychological and sociological algorithms);
        at some point, the legislature would be forced to accept many of these
        civil normalization procedures (at first temporarily or for certain activities),
        and finally the two systems could be integrated into one Internet-based,
        democratic and professional solution.
