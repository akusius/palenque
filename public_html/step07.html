        Let's inspect and analyze carefully the pattern we got as a result
        after executing the rotations and the reflection:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s07i01.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s07i01.png" alt="Control phase">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a3a3"><a class="anchor" href="#a3a3"></a>
        The pattern is clearly divided into an inner and an outer part,
        furthermore the elements outside are all placed on the edges of a square:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s07i02.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s07i02.png" alt="Control phase with highlights">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a7e1"><a class="anchor" href="#a7e1"></a>
        The important question is, of course, how likely it is to have such
        an organized arrangement after performing the preceding operations.
        Obviously, the duplications and rotations themselves cause a high amount of
        symmetry (similarly to a kaleidoscope), as each item is octupled now.
        But is this effect (which, by the way, will not be exploited in the solution,
        as we will use only one quarter of
        <a href="step11.html" title="Step 11: The Final Figure">the final figure</a>)
        itself enough to explain the type of regularity we are observing here?
        Or, more precisely: what is the probability to get
        a similarly well-arranged pattern as a result
        after performing the rotational operations on an arbitrarily selected initial layout?
      </p>
      <p id="abbb"><a class="anchor" href="#abbb"></a>
        There are two approaches to answer these questions: practically (i.e. trial and error)
        and theoretically.
        Let's start with the first method, and carry out the operations on
        other layouts as well.
      </p>
      <p id="ae11"><a class="anchor" href="#ae11"></a>
        As I already mentioned in <a href="step04.html#a38c" title="Step 4: The Item Layout">step 4</a>,
        a separate Java application (<a href="applay.html" title="PalenqueLayout (Java Application)">PalenqueLayout</a>)
        was created for this very purpose. With the help of it you can build different
        layouts, and then execute the rotations on them to check
        the final state (i.e. this control phase).
        To demonstrate that our initial layout is indeed a (very) special one,
        I'd like to present in the following some other layouts constructed with this program
        (more precisely they were composed by randomizing the default layout multiple times),
        that have the exact same items (10 triplets, 1 Sun and 1 star symbol),
        but placed at different positions. On the left side the initial state is shown,
        while on the right the end state after the rotations and reflection.
      </p>

        Layout #1 (<small>PQLT9397T9898T9610T0896T7714T0521T2123T9484S9882T1285T1496R2192</small>):

        Layout #3 (<small>PQLT9889T0088R8306S8411T1207T1503T2209T8198T8699T8892T1183T1688</small>):

      </div>
      <p class="note" id="a9a4"><a class="anchor" href="#a9a4"></a>
        Note: These layouts were selected purely by chance, and the vast majority
        of the layouts are just very similar (in the sense of all being chaotic).
        With the <a href="applay.html" title="PalenqueLayout (Java Application)">PalenqueLayout</a> utility
        you can rebuild and test these arrangements by importing the codes in parentheses,
        or you can also build new ones from scratch.
      </p>
      <p id="abb5"><a class="anchor" href="#abb5"></a>
        As we can see, the same "kaleidoscopical" symmetry, caused by the reflections
        themselves, can be noticed also here,
        but we don't recognize at all that organized and arranged appearance,
        that was observable at our initial layout above: there are no inner and outer
        parts separated, the items are not joined to larger shapes, there is no
        square to link the elements together, and so on.
      </p>
      <p id="a91f"><a class="anchor" href="#a91f"></a>
        So, it seems clear that our layout is indeed special to some extent:
        the question is, of course, exactly <em>how</em> special it is,
        how many other layouts could exist in theory with a similarly well-arranged
        control phase state. To be honest, giving a precise answer
        exceeds (by far) my mathematical abilities, and so I rather would
        <a href="ftasks.html#theory" title="Theoretical framework | Further Tasks">let others</a>, equipped with more advanced apparatus,
        compute this probability exactly, based on some geometrical framework (yet to be created?)
        for this and analogous coding systems.
      </p>
      <p id="af2e"><a class="anchor" href="#af2e"></a>
        Thus for now, until the theoretical background is clarified,
        we must settle for the practical approach,
        try different layouts by moving items around,
        and see whether we can arrive at any state as orderly as the one above.
        I myself have not been able to find any other layouts (aside from the variations of this of course) with even approximate
        (let alone same or exceeding) level of regularity,
        but encourage anybody interested in the subject to try this him/herself by
        using the <a href="applay.html" title="PalenqueLayout (Java Application)">PalenqueLayout</a> utility (or by any
        other means). I personally am quite sure that the item arrangement on the lid is
        very (very) special if not unique, and to me this singularity is also a clear indication that
        the triplets are certainly not there for decoration purposes,
        but instead they were placed at their positions as constituent parts of a coding method,
        moreover by some beings with a very (very) high level of intelligence,
        since, presumably, we, present day humans ourselves
        <a href="step12.html#a273" title="Step 12: Conclusions">would not manage</a>
        to construct such a sophisticated encoding.
        But, of course, these are just intuitions and more (mainly theoretical)
        work <a href="ftasks.html#theory" title="Theoretical framework | Further Tasks">is needed</a> to obtain an absolute (or at least reasonable) assurance.
      </p>
      <p id="ace1"><a class="anchor" href="#ace1"></a>
        It also seems to be clear, that this control phase was included in the
        process by the designers in order to enable us, the decoders
        to correct the inaccuracies introduced by the representation.
        For this purpose the control phase is so sensitive
        (which is of course advantageous in this situation),
        that already moving one single item by only 1 or 2 units can easily break it.
        For example, in <a href="step04.html#af71" title="Step 4: The Item Layout">step 4</a> we have seen, that the Sun item
        (#11) did not cover completely the symbol under it, and so we could be
        tempted to move it one square to the left, from
        (&minus;11,&nbsp;&minus;20) to (&minus;12,&nbsp;&minus;20).
        But if we did so, the symmetry on the edge would be broken immediately, as the symbol
        would be closer now to the corners than to the middle elements:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s07i06.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s07i06.png" alt="Wrong position for the Sun">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a87d"><a class="anchor" href="#a87d"></a>
        In this step we have thoroughly analyzed the control phase state,
        and have ascertained (to the degree achievable without
        a theoretically established framework for such types of encodings) that:
        1. the layout presented in <a href="step04.html#afab" title="Step 4: The Item Layout">step 4</a>
        indeed seems be the closest one to the design originally conceived;
        2. this reconstructed layout is so special (if not unique)
        with regard to the resulting state after performing
        the rotational operations, that it should make us
        at least suspicious about the explanation of the triplets
        being mere decorations, and should inspire us to go further in
        exploring the peculiarities of this pattern.
      </p>
      <p id="a1f0"><a class="anchor" href="#a1f0"></a>
        So, step after step it becomes more and more probable, that the code
        does really exist, and that we are on the right track to "crack" it.
        But we are only in the middle of the process, and certainly
        several new puzzles are there waiting for us.
        Let's see, whether we will be able to solve them too!
