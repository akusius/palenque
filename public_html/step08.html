        After performing the rotations and checking the layout at the control
        phase, we may be a bit lost about what to do next, what the next step
        should be in solving the code. The pattern seems to be finished now,
        and no rotation or reflection could make it even more complete.
        Nonetheless, we feel, that the process must go further somehow,
        that there must still be operations left to perform. But how to find them?
      </p>
      <p id="aad4"><a class="anchor" href="#aad4"></a>
        Before possibly getting desperate, let's take a fresh look at the control phase
        pattern, and try to understand, what we are observing:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08i01.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s08i01.png" alt="Starting state">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a0db"><a class="anchor" href="#a0db"></a>
        The picture is clearly divided into an inner and an outer part
        (as we have already recognized it in <a href="step07.html" title="Step 7: The Control Phase">the previous step</a>).
        Considering <a href="step03.html" title="Step 3: The Interstellar Travel">the message we are searching for</a>
        (the location of the other solar system),
        it also seems to be obvious, that the outer part plays the more important role,
        since both the Sun and the star symbols are placed there.
        But then what purpose does the inner part serve for, what could be its function
        in the solution?
      </p>
      <p id="af20"><a class="anchor" href="#af20"></a>
        Let's think... We must perform some operations on the items of the outer edge,
        that seems evident...
        Isn't it possible, that the inner elements are there
        to instruct us, what operations to execute? That they could be the
        guides helping us to find the next necessary move? That maybe we should
        link the outer and inner shapes to each other, and then carry out
        the same actions on each outer item, as its corresponding
        inner counterpart indicates us to do?
      </p>
      <p id="a476"><a class="anchor" href="#a476"></a>
        Let's verify, whether this idea would be feasible! At this stage we could attach (based on their positions and appearance) the inner and the outer
        items to each other in the following way (only one link per type is shown):
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08i02.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s08i02.png" alt="Attached elements highlighted">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a646"><a class="anchor" href="#a646"></a>
        All the attachments visualized by different colors:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08i03.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s08i03.png" alt="Attachments visualised by colors">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a0c8"><a class="anchor" href="#a0c8"></a>
        The inner items may suggest us to "push them together",
        i.e. to move them toward the center.
        And this would mean, of course,
        that we should move each outer shape as well,
        in the same direction and by the same distance
        as the inner shape attached to it:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08i04.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s08i04.png" alt="Arrows showing the movements">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="abc6"><a class="anchor" href="#abc6"></a>
        Let's try, and perform the operation in two phases. First we move the corner elements:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08a01.gif">
          <img class="framed anim" src="media/s08a01.gif" alt="Moving the corner elements">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p class="note" id="ace9"><a class="anchor" href="#ace9"></a>
        Note: we do not push them together completely, as there must be enough room
        left for the middle items (coming on the way).
      </p>
      <p id="a9fd"><a class="anchor" href="#a9fd"></a>
        Then the middle elements:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08a02.gif">
          <img class="framed anim" src="media/s08a02.gif" alt="Moving the middle elements">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a242"><a class="anchor" href="#a242"></a>
        For checking purposes the two motions together with grid turned on:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08a03.gif">
          <img class="framed anim" src="media/s08a03.gif" alt="Two motions together with grid">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a454"><a class="anchor" href="#a454"></a>
        And the end state after having executed the operation:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s08i05.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s08i05.png" alt="End state after moving">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="afd3"><a class="anchor" href="#afd3"></a>
        It seems that the idea is working so far!
        With its help we were indeed able to take the solution one step further again.
        Let's also recognize, how elegantly the designers of the code
        bring the Sun and star symbols into an offset position to each other!
        Of course it would have been possible to have this configuration
        right after the rotations, but then we could not have had the opportunity
        to check the layout in the control phase.
        So at first an arrangement with all the elements placed on the same line
        was created, in order to make the test possible,
        and then in this step the items are finally moved into their positions.
        A beautiful piece of work (once again)!
      </p>
      <p id="af6c"><a class="anchor" href="#af6c"></a>
        In the next step we will continue applying the idea we have just found,
        that is, we will perform the very same actions on the outer elements,
        which the inner elements attached to them indicate us to do.
