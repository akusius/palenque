        The first and foremost task would of course be to review the solution
        carefully and (preferably) with scientific accuracy.
        Since the "established" science (as we all happen to know)
        does not really like to deal with such topics
        (which, to be honest, after the "theories" of DÃ¤niken and
        consorts is a bit understandable), at first perhaps we, the Internet community
        should inspect and examine the solution,
        and then (if it has proven to be true or at least justifiable)
        popularize it in a way that at some point the academic world
        would finally be compelled to take it as a hypothesis seriously
        and analyze it thoroughly.
      </p>
      <h3 id="theory"><a class="anchor" href="#theory"></a>Theoretical framework</h3>
      <p id="a180"><a class="anchor" href="#a180"></a>
        In order to review and (potentially) confirm the hypothesis, apparently
        a new theoretical framework needs to be created first, since the encoding
        method seems not to be covered by the existing theories.
        The new framework should enable us to compute exactly what probability
        it has to come to a state like that in the
        <a href="step07.html" title="Step 7: The Control Phase">control phase</a> from an arbitrary initial layout,
        and it would be great, if we also had an algorithm to construct similar
        encoding procedures.
        Obviously, given a coordinate range and an item set,
        calculating the total number of possible layouts is a trivial task,
        but determining which layouts should be considered to be well-arranged
        is not self-evident at all (at least to me it was not),
        and certainly requires a more advanced mathematical approach.
      </p>
      <p id="a8d0"><a class="anchor" href="#a8d0"></a>
        To illustrate the requirements and the difficulties
        with regard to a theoretical framework,
        let's try to compute the probability for a very basic scenario.
        Let's have a coordinate range from (&minus;25,&nbsp;&minus;25) to (25,&nbsp;25)
        and two 3&times;3-sized symbols: a Sun placed at (&minus;11,&nbsp;&minus;20) and
        a star symbol placed anywhere else arbitrarily (but not colliding with the Sun).
        The question is: how probable is it to have such a position for the star symbol
        that after performing the rotational and reflectional operations
        the two symbols and their reflections all will be placed on the edges of a
        square?
      </p>
      <p id="a5c6"><a class="anchor" href="#a5c6"></a>
        The vertices of the square that should contain the elements on its edges are
        (determined by the location of the Sun symbol):
        (&minus;20,&nbsp;&minus;20), (&minus;20,&nbsp;20), (20,&nbsp;20) and (20,&nbsp;&minus;20).
        Obviously, the star symbol must already be placed on the square
        before the rotations, as these operations do not move the elements
        out of the square they were positioned on initially (which square is
        defined by the larger one of the absolute coordinate values).
        There are 160 different possibilities to locate a star symbol (or
        any other item) on the edges of a 41&times;41 square (39 on each side + 4 corners),
        but we must eliminate those cases, where the two symbols (or any of
        their copies) collide with each other.
        By a single Sun there are 7 invalid positions (e.g. from
        (&minus;14,&nbsp;&minus;20) to (&minus;8,&nbsp;&minus;20) by the original one),
        and so 8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;56 altogether (since the Sun symbols are far from the corners,
        there are no overlaps we should consider).
        Subtracting this from 160 gives 104 possible positions for the star
        symbol, and if we accept only those initial arrangements, where the two symbols
        are located on a different edge, i.e. the star symbol cannot be placed on the edge
        from (&minus;20,&nbsp;&minus;20) to (20,&nbsp;&minus;20),
        then the number of the valid positions decreases further by 27 to 77.
      </p>
      <p id="a233"><a class="anchor" href="#a233"></a>
        Computing the total number of the possible placements for the star
        symbol is much easier. It can be placed (almost) anywhere inside
        the 49&times;49-sized square from (&minus;24,&nbsp;&minus;24) to
        (24,&nbsp;24), which gives 49&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;49&nbsp;=&nbsp;2401 different locations
        (naturally, we cannot place the symbol directly on the edges because of its size).
        But we must eliminate those cases, where it would be too close to the
        Sun symbol, which has a 7&times;7-sized "fence" around it,
        resulting in 2401&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;2352 possibilities altogether.
        So, we can finally calculate the probability for this (very simple) scenario:
        104&nbsp;/&nbsp;2352&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;4.42%,
        and if the star symbol cannot be located initially on the same line as
        the Sun, then this probability decreases further to:
        77&nbsp;/&nbsp;2352&nbsp;&asymp;&nbsp;3.27%.
      </p>
      <p id="a85d"><a class="anchor" href="#a85d"></a>
        Of course, for a full-fledged probability computation
        the triplets must also be taken into account
        (thus reducing further the calculated probability significantly),
        the Sun's position should be modifiable,
        and many many other enhancements are needed,
        which would require a more advanced mathematical apparatus
        that I personally can come up with. The best would be to have
        a definite probability value at the end of the calculations,
        which could be a clear indication about the randomness or intentionality
        of the original design, concerning the apparently well-arranged state of the
        <a href="step07.html" title="Step 7: The Control Phase">control phase</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="a014"><a class="anchor" href="#a014"></a>
        We should recognize that this analysis and the framework could be completely separated
        from the (much more fantastical) hypothesis about <a href="step03.html" title="Step 3: The Interstellar Travel">the interstellar travel</a>
        and the interpretation of the <a href="step11.html" title="Step 11: The Final Figure">final figure</a>
        (as it was already mentioned <a href="step12.html#a6fe" title="Step 12: Conclusions">here</a>).
        This part of the solution is purely mathematical,
        and a well-established theory for it could have the potential
        of (dis)proving its correctness with an almost absolute certainty.
        Because of the problem's complexity it is surely not
        an easy task to construct such a theoretical framework, but it is definitely feasible,
        and its existence could benefit (at least in my opinion) the science
        or even the whole mankind.
      </p>
      <p id="a90a"><a class="anchor" href="#a90a"></a>
        It should also be noticed that they are two completely different topics,
        whether the solution (or its geometric part) itself is provable and comprehensible
        (which is a code breaking issue), and whether the ancient Mayan
        (or any other) culture could indeed have the knowledge required
        for constructing a coding system of this kind (which is a historical question).
        Unfortunately, until we have an almost hundred percent certain proof in our hand
        that some ancient culture did really possess the necessary intelligence,
        the historical considerations will always be strong enough to discredit
        the efforts to crack such supposed coding systems.
        Therefore, the best strategy could be to separate these two approaches entirely,
        and to examine the solution (or primarily its geometrical part) at first exclusively on its own,
        as if it were a present day code breaking problem,
        and only after we have already analyzed thoroughly the procedure on this assumption,
        should we turn our attention to the historical question and to
        the issues around it.
      </p>
      <p id="aaa7"><a class="anchor" href="#aaa7"></a>
        As to the encoding algorithm, as a first step it could be sufficient to
        have one that would be able to construct a normalized initial layout
        from a state similar to that in the <a href="step07.html" title="Step 7: The Control Phase">control phase</a>.
        Obviously, it would be much more difficult to build this initial layout
        from the very final state, as in <a href="step11.html" title="Step 11: The Final Figure">step 11</a>,
        because in this case we would have to define operations and procedures
        for recognizing similarities between shapes, which task could easily turn out to be
        too heuristic for the computational technology of today.
        But, of course, it would be great to have such an algorithm, and we
        could even use it or one of its modified versions for encoding and decoding
        messages, which can be represented by shapes and layout configurations in some analogous way.

        If the solution proves to be true, it could then be advisable
        to examine the nearby solar systems even more carefully,
        and search for such binary systems whose distance from the Sun
        is around 13 light years,
        and have three inner and three outer planets
        (as depicted on the supposed <a href="step03.html#a8b2" title="Step 3: The Interstellar Travel">diagram</a> of the other system).
        Ideally, only one system would satisfy all the conditions, and
        then it could be an obvious candidate to search for extra-terrestrial life.
