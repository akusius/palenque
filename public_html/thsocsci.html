      <h3>Social Sciences</h3>
      <p id="ad34"><a class="anchor" href="#ad34"></a>
        Unfortunately, the social sciences of today clearly perform much worse,
        than they could and also should, in order to support the civilization
        intellectually and efficiently in its struggle against the purely
        materialistic world view (invented, perfected and to this day
        assertively forced by the natural sciences).
        There seem to be multiple, diverse problems causing this underperformance,
        and in this section we try to identify (briefly) the most important of them, together with their possible resolutions.
      </p>
      <p id="a7ff"><a class="anchor" href="#a7ff"></a>
        First of all, the phenomena analyzed and described by the social
        sciences are obviously much more complex and convoluted, than that of the natural
        sciences. The physical processes can be effectively separated from each other (at least mostly),
        they can be reproduced in laboratories and analyzed repeatedly with small
        modifications; on the contrary, the social occurrences are often complicated and
        irreproducible, and the factors behind them hard to isolate and analyze.
        But this problem could not justify in itself the undeniable deficiencies
        in the theories of the social sciences, especially, since also the physics and
        other natural sciences have to deal with long and complex processes occasionally,
        and they are clearly more successful at doing this.
      </p>
      <p id="ad50"><a class="anchor" href="#ad50"></a>
        Secondly, the social science is due to its
        <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_envy">physics envy</a>
        apparently too impatient and not willing to accept that in its current, immature state
        it is not ready yet to supply such scientifically well-founded and proven theories,
        which could compete with those of the natural sciences in terms of
        exactness, reproducibility and indisputability.
        The social science is approximately at the same level today,
        where the natural science stood in the 16th century, and it actually should
        measure itself to the natural science of that time not of the present.
        But it does exactly this latter, which results in a hypocritical and frustrated
        manner of theory creation and presentation, discrediting the
        social sciences even more.
      </p>
      <p id="ad92"><a class="anchor" href="#ad92"></a>
        A severe methodical problem originates from the social sciences'
        unreasonable striving to completely mimic the procedures of the natural sciences,
        and to use arithmetical models by all means for making the theories (seemingly) more accurate,
        which leads to the misapplication of mathematical
        (and especially statistical) techniques for defining and measuring social
        variables and in the search for relationships between them.
        E.g., let's suppose, we would try to measure somehow the psychological
        qualities of extraversion and intelligence and the connection between them.
        Today, the procedure would be to construct a questionnaire with scales (e.g. 1 to 5)
        that attempt to "measure" the various aspects of these qualities through different questions,
        then to apply an arithmetical model on the marked numbers of the scales to summarize
        those and get an aggregate figure for both qualities,
        and finally to search for statistical correlations between the
        sums in the dataset and (potentially) to interpret them as indications of a relationship between the two traits.
        This approach <em>seems</em> to be scientific (since it uses numbers
        and mathematical models), but in reality this accuracy is only confined
        to the current questionnaire, to the persons who took part
        on the survey and to the model that was applied to the dataset,
        and the results can hardly be reproduced (or even interpreted) by other
        teams and/or within (even only slightly) modified circumstances.
        The main problem is that we are fixated on using numbers for the sake
        of accuracy, and this drastically reduces the generalizability of the model,
        because we are now bound to this actual survey and to the scales contained in it.
        Furthermore, it is already strongly questionable, whether the usage of numbers
        for psychological qualities can be justified at all, since it seems not
        to have much sense of speaking about e.g. twice as large extraversion or
        an intelligence 20 percent less.
        Considering these problems, apparently another approach would be needed,
        which does provide accurate measuring capabilities, but without the need of the usage of numbers
        and arithmetical models for the psychological (or other social) qualities.
      </p>
      <p id="a914"><a class="anchor" href="#a914"></a>
        Those with computer programming background surely all know the
        (at first rather surprisingly) fact, that in the various object oriented
        languages and libraries every object type (even the most complex one)
        can be placed into a perfectly defined scale according to one of its characteristic
        <em>without the need of using any numbers</em> during the scale creation procedure.
        E.g. in Java the
        <a class="external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html"><code>Comparator&lt;T&gt;</code></a>
        interface and its
        <a class="external" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#compare-T-T-"><code>int compare(T o1, T o2)</code></a>
        method can be used (in C#:
        <a class="external" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xh5ks3b3%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"><code>int IComparer&lt;T&gt;.Compare (T x, T y)</code></a>)
        to compare any two objects according to a quality,
        and to determine a relation between them (less, equal or greater).
        The comparing method has to fulfill some very important requirements
        (it has to be <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">transitive</a>,
        must give the opposite result for a switched pair,
        and must place all equal elements on the same side of any third elements),
        but has not to use any numbers for the comparison
        (it is actually indifferent, how exactly the comparison method works,
        while it can fulfill these requirements).
        Performing this very simple, elementary comparison operation multiple times
        on object pairs (selected by some sorting algorithm), we can finally get
        a perfectly defined scale built from the objects according to that quality
        (or can conclude that our comparison method is faulty, if it supplies
        inconsistent results during the sorting).
        We can also easily put any new object into this scale at the right position,
        by using the very same simple comparison method,
        and with the help of it we are even able to compare two complete scales
        for their equality and for their level of divergence.
        It means that this perfectly defined scale (created without any numbers)
        can be used as a ruler or a measurement tape for that quality it was built upon,
        since any element can be measured against it,
        and can be labeled with the position (or name) of the scale's nearest item to it.
      </p>
      <p id="a0e3"><a class="anchor" href="#a0e3"></a>
        Could not we possibly use this procedure outside the object oriented
        programming realm too, for instance in the social sciences to measure
        variables, to build scales for these measurements and to
        compare these scales regarding their equalities and level
        of divergences?
        E.g., in order to measure the psychological quality of the extraversion
        with a scientific accuracy,
        it would be (perhaps a bit surprisingly) completely adequate to possess only one single elementary comparison function,
        which is able to determine (consistently) the relation between any two
        persons' extraversion characteristic, i.e. can
        say, which one of the two is more extraverted
        (or if there is no (determinable) difference between them).
        Applying this function (and a sorting algorithm) on a sufficiently high
        number of individuals (tens or even hundreds),
        we would finally get a very fine graded scale for this quality,
        which could also be used to measure (similarly to a ruler)
        the extraversion quality of any other person.
        And, analogously, we could construct another scale for the
        quality of intelligence, and then analyze the level of congruence
        or divergence between the two scales
        (with the classical methods of the mathematics and geometry).
      </p>
      <p id="aa4e"><a class="anchor" href="#aa4e"></a>
        Let's go (briefly) over the advantages, which this measuring method could provide,
        contrary to the arithmetical approach enforced today.
        First, the measuring function is obviously much simpler and more elementary,
        than the number scales used in the questionnaires.
        Actually, when we classify a quality with a number
        from 1 to 5, we perform unconsciously a very similar
        procedure, during that we compare the current item with the
        minimum and maximum we know (or could imagine), and
        then try to assign a number based on these comparisons.
        It would be much easier (and much less error-prone),
        if we could (and also would be urged to) perform these comparisons
        explicitly, and the scale would be created only as the final
        step, after we have already compared each (or enough) pair of items.
      </p>
      <p id="ad60"><a class="anchor" href="#ad60"></a>
        Such a comparison function (comparing two
        items from a certain aspect) is an elementary
        and very common operation of the human mind; in fact,
        this seems to be one of the strongest capability of
        our brain, which runs automatically and unconsciously
        behind a lot of more complex thinking and analyzing mental procedures.
        This simplicity and elementariness could make this method
        eminently suitable for using it as a survey tool,
        since this function is known to everybody and performed everyday (many times),
        and it is much easier and common to compare two items
        directly, as to give both of them (independently from each other)
        a classifying number from 1 to 5.
        Furthermore, the brain is much more consistent (because of their basic nature) in
        providing such types of comparisons, while
        assigning a scaling number to an individual object or occurrence
        can vary even for the same person from survey to survey (or yet from question to question).
      </p>
      <p id="ab82"><a class="anchor" href="#ab82"></a>
        Very useful (from a scientific point of view) is the "brutality"
        of the comparison function, which forces us to compare two
        items directly from a certain aspect, and does not allow us
        to avoid making a potentially impolite or insulting relation
        between two persons or other objects (which we would certainly
        try to avoid in the everyday life, when we should decide e.g.
        which one of two women is the more beautiful, or which one of
        two men the better and closer friend).
        The science cannot tolerate any tactfulness or sensitivity
        when determining the scientific truths, since this could decrease
        significantly the accuracy of the theories
        (to an extent threatening even their validity),
        and such a "merciless" function could considerably help
        eliminate the delicateness from the process
        (like in the natural sciences the invention of "tyrannically"
        unquestionable and indisputable measuring methods for
        lengths, time intervals, forces, etc. was essential for
        the further development).
        This brutality could also be beneficial for the person
        itself who performs this comparison, as he/she would be compelled
        and urged to take a position in this question, and to analyze and clarify
        his/her own thoughts and feelings (in fact, this method on its own
        could already be a valuable help in e.g. the psychological or psychoanalytical
        practice, or anywhere else, where there is a requirement to uncover
        hidden attitudes, opinions and sympathies).
      </p>
      <p id="a072"><a class="anchor" href="#a072"></a>
        A significant advantage would also be the fact, that the sorting algorithm
        itself already automatically validates the comparing function (at least technically),
        and (at a sufficient high number of objects and comparisons)
        it turns out without any further analyzation, if the
        function is faulty or not working consistently
        (for this purpose it would be advisable to compare all
        items pairwise, even if the sorting algorithm itself would not
        require this, especially at the beginning of using a function).
      </p>
      <p id="a4fb"><a class="anchor" href="#a4fb"></a>
        Applying this measuring method could facilitate considerably the
        exchange of the scientific results between various groups
        and laboratories, since the elementary comparing function
        could be publicized, analyzed and exchanged already in itself,
        before any further conclusions or without any complex theories.
        In fact, the primary activity of the scientific groups could be
        to construct and verify such comparing methods, and to assure
        that these are functioning in a consistent and coherent way,
        since the conclusions about the qualities and their relationships
        could be almost mechanically deduced, once these comparing
        functions perform flawlessly.
        The results of one group could be much more easily verified
        and reproduced by other teams, since they could check
        the suggested comparison method technically and substantially
        by performing (re)sorts using it on their own objects or with their own
        comparing staff.
        Essentially, a well constructed comparison method should sort
        consistently the same objects always the same way,
        and also new elements introduced to it should be immediately placed
        into their right positions, completely independently from the team,
        who actually performs the operation.
        E.g., in the example above, one scientific group could
        work out a method, which compares two persons from the aspect
        of their extraversion (giving a &lt;, = or &gt; result),
        and then the following requirements should be fulfilled in order
        to accept this method as scientifically correct:
        1. a given person set must always be (re)sorted
        into the very same order (the possible equal elements could of course be
        in arbitrary order among each other); 2. any other
        team performing the sort on this person set must get the
        very same result; 3. any two persons selected by any team
        must be comparable by this method;
        4. the method must function properly and consistently
        on any person set selected by any team in the world.
        A comparing method can be as simple as taking a look
        at two persons and determine the relation between them
        intuitively, or as complex as running through days or even
        weeks of various tests and analyzation to choose the
        right one (the lesser or the greater according to the method)
        from the two persons; but it must always supply a relation
        between two items from a certain aspect, and should not even try
        to evaluate them independently from each other.
      </p>
      <p id="abdc"><a class="anchor" href="#abdc"></a>
        With the help of well-functioning comparison methods, reference
        lists could be constructed, which then could be used to measure
        other items and to assign them a value or a name according to their
        (hypothetical) position in this list.
        For this purpose, well-known, simple and unchangeable reference objects
        should be chosen, e.g. (imaginary) persons of novels, theater plays, comics,
        films and computer games, or new ones should be created, if there are
        no suitable objects existing yet for a certain quality or aspect.
        After creating the reference list, any living person could be measured against this
        scale, and it could get a name or a label based on its
        position in relation to the reference objects.
        With this procedure, an individual's personality could be
        determined quickly and described in a unified way, which
        description could be interpreted by anybody, exclusively
        on the basis of the reference objects and the applied comparing methods.
      </p>
      <p id="a706"><a class="anchor" href="#a706"></a>
        A (consistent and already established) comparison function could also be used to test
        the comparing abilities of a person, and to teach him/her
        about the aspect behind the method and the procedure to perform the comparison.
        E.g., if we already have a well-functioning method to
        compare the extraversion quality of two persons, then
        everybody must get the same results performing this operation
        on a selected pair, and if somebody does get a diverging result,
        then it shows, that he or she has an improper notion of the
        extraversion quality, and should modify his/her own
        conceptions and ideas to make them congruent with the
        scientific way of thinking and understanding.
      </p>
      <p id="a7df"><a class="anchor" href="#a7df"></a>
        A well-behaving comparison method could also be used in
        reverse mode, i.e. to define new qualities and variables,
        and to teach and train this new conception to anybody,
        exclusively with the help of this comparing function (and possibly a reference list).
        E.g., let's suppose, we have a method to measure
        consistently "something", but we do not have a notion
        for this quality yet; instead of characterizing it textually,
        the comparison function and a reference list is perfectly
        sufficient to define this new quality, and to make
        anybody able to use it in itself or as a basis for other,
        more complex properties.
        Of course, in the everyday practice the two approaches (direct and reverse mode)
        would usually be followed simultaneously: at first we would try to
        create a function to measure a common quality with scientific accuracy, but
        at some point we would most certainly realize that it is too
        complex and impure to get handled by a method consistently,
        and then we would start to clean it and separate it into (sub)conceptions,
        which would be defined accurately and precisely with the help
        of the constructed comparison methods and the created reference lists.
        By using this method consequently,
        the social sciences could get finally a completely new and exactly
        defined terminology, where each conception is entirely characterized and described
        with its corresponding comparison function and (optionally)
        a reference object list.
      </p>
      <p id="ab52"><a class="anchor" href="#ab52"></a>
        After discussing the measuring problem and suggesting a (potential)
        solution to this problem, let's review briefly the remaining most important
        possible issues behind the failures of the social science.
        First, the activities in it should obviously not
        be organized already to the extent, as it is the case today (mainly due to
        the unhealthy mimicking of the natural science), since
        at this phase (analogous to the state of the natural science in the 16th century)
        rather genial individuals would be needed and not professional scientists
        working in over-organized and bureaucratic conditions.
        It is also questionable, whether the social science
        should <em>ever</em> be professionally organized in the manner the
        natural science is, because ideally it should also have the
        task (additionally to the knowledge acquiring) to cultivate
        the public and to make everybody to
        a learned and experienced psychologist, sociologist and
        philosopher eventually.
        Perhaps the best solution could be, if the social science activities were
        organized mainly through the Internet, and the majority of the works
        were carried out by (half)dilettante "scientists",
        who could share and discuss their own everyday experiences
        in a standardized way, for example using the constructed
        comparison methods described above.
        In this model, not final theories with exactly formulated conclusions
        would be created by professional scientists,
        but instead everybody could classify his/her own current life situation
        and problems with the help of the comparison methods
        (e.g. by choosing, which one of two shown situations is closer to his/her),
        and this way could find analogous case-studies and problems,
        together with the applied and suggested solutions.
        In this system, there would be no explicitly formulated and
        deducted hypotheses really needed, because the phenomena themselves
        would already be documented through the Internet,
        and everybody could use his/her own reasoning to discover regularities and
        relationships in them, eventually becoming an experienced
        and learned social scientist him/herself.
        The main end product of the social science would be
        (instead of theses and publications) a cultivated and enlightened society,
        with socially highly intelligent and wise individuals.
