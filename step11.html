        The resulting state again, after performing all the transformation steps:

      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11i01.png">

        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        It's clear, that due to the rotations at the beginning
        there is a lot of redundancy
        in the image, and we will need only one quarter of it in the interpretation.
        The inner shape is also superfluous now, as it has already played its role
        by guiding us through the second half of the solving process.
        Let's remove these elements:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11a01.gif">
          <img class="framed anim" src="media/s11a01.gif" alt="Removing the elements">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p id="a564">
        Here is the final figure, that we have to interpret,
        and that should in some way help us identify the other solar system:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11i02.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s11i02.png" alt="Final figure to interpret">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Before interpreting it, we should recall, that the symbol for the other star(s)
        is originally not symmetrical
        (and was depicted so only for the sake of simplicity),
        but has a closing part on its upper side:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11i03.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s11i03.png" alt="Other star symbol">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        If we integrate these closing parts, with the proper directions,
        into the final figure, we get this picture:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11i04.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s11i04.png" alt="Final figure with closing elements">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        This could reassure us again that the other stars are indeed looking
        into the direction of the Sun while they are separated from the
        other parts of the picture (that we have already removed).
        But, actually, what does this picture tell us, what could be the message it holds?
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, it appears to indicate, that the other system
        is a binary system consisting of two stars.
        Then, it is also likely, that the squares among the Sun and the other
        star(s) should measure the distance between them somehow.
        Of course,
        without any commonly definable and mutually agreeable absolute units
        (as it is the case when sending a message to an alien civilization),
        the only possible way to do this is to use a relative distance
        defined by some reference point.
        In the matter of our solar system and its nearby neighbors
        the most natural reference point (from our view)
        that comes to mind, is obviously the nearest star to the Sun,
        the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, whose distance from us could serve as a cosmical unit for
        measuring other, larger distances.
        Certainly, with this method only very imprecise measurements can
        be performed, but in the absence of common absolute units
        this is the maximum we can have (and for making us aware of
        other civilizations near us it could also be more than enough).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is fairly probable, that our final figure
        is indeed to be interpreted as a distance measurement of this type:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11i05.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s11i05.png" alt="Distances shown">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        And, after "closing the scissor", we finally have the message that
        to reveal this whole long procedure seems to have been aimed at:
      </p>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11a02.gif">
          <img class="framed anim" src="media/s11a02.gif" alt="Final message animated">
        </a>
      </div>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
        <a class="img" href="media/s11i06.png">
          <img class="framed" src="media/s11i06.png" alt="Final message">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The final message: <em>the other solar system, which served as the starting
          point for <a href="step03.html" title="Step 3: The Interstellar Travel">the interstellar travel</a>,
          consists of two stars, and is three times as far away from us, as the nearest
          star, the Proxima Centauri.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>
        is about 4.24 light years from the Sun,
        the binary system we are looking for is located somewhere around the
        13 ly distance.
        Based on
        <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs">this data</a>
        the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCR_1845-6357">SCR 1845-6357</a> (12.57 ly)
        and the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruger_60">Kruger 60</a> (13.15 ly)
        systems could be the most promising candidates,
        but the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_614">Ross 614</a> (13.3 ly),
        the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_424">Wolf 424</a>
        (14.2 ly)
        and several other systems should also be considered.
        Of course, the distance in itself (especially determined by such a rough method)
        is not sufficient to choose the right one, a lot of other
        aspects needs to be examined, e.g. the type of the system,
        the number of the planets in it
        (according to <a href="step03.html#a8b2" title="Step 3: The Interstellar Travel">the diagram</a> it should
        have 3 inner and 3 outer planets), the possibility of life, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is already <a href="ftasks.html#astronomy" title="Astronomical examinations | Further Tasks">a task for the future</a>,
        and for now we can be completely satisfied with our result,
        as, apparently, we have in fact solved the code successfully!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final step we will review the transformation process in short,
        and draw our conclusions about the encoding method and the solution.
